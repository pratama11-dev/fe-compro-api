      "WEICON HP is a 2-component epoxy resin with longer curing time, enormous impact strength as well as high residual elasticity and abrasion resistance. Due to its high elongation at break and paste-like texture, WEICON HP can be used for repairs, as abrasion protection as well as for lining heavily stressed equipment. The adhesive also shows excellent adhesion to wet and damp surfaces and in underwater applications.",

      "EonCoat’s Corrosion Protection Coating is our flagship product and an incredibly effective way to permanently protect carbon steel from corrosion. As the foundation of all our products, EonCoat Corrosion Protection is spray-applied at a 1:1 ratio to form the two-component protective coating for carbon steel. Once this product is mixed with the carbon steel, a chemical reaction takes place that creates two layers of corrosion protection. One layer is iron phosphate, and the other layer is ceramic filled with phosphate. These two layers are the key to permanent corrosion protection. These two layers are the key to permanent corrosion protection.",
