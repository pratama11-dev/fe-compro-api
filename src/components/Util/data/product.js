      "EonCoat’s CUI (corrosion under insulation) Coating works just like our EonCoat Corrosion Protection Coating by alloying the carbon steel after one application lays down both layers of protection. This chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coating is rated from -256°F to 842°F (-160°C to 450°C) and performs exceptionally well under insulation where moisture can easily creep in and create corrosion. While EonCoatCUI is applied at atmospheric conditions, it does an amazing job handling extreme temperatures of carbon steel assets under insulation.",
